Sensor Tracker Client Library
=============

This library provides a pure Python interface for the Sensor Tracker Client


Installing
----------

Install through pip:

    pip install git+https://gitlab.oceantrack.org/ceotr/metadata-tracker/sensor_tracker_client.git


Usage Examples
--------------
 
The API is exposed via the ``sensor_tracker_client``  class.

For starters, the library is using singleton pattern. The object will be instantiated as soon as you import the class.

    >>> from sensor_tracker_client import sensor_tracker_client as stc

Make sure to set up the basic configurations before using the other functions. It needs to be configured only once at the beginning of the script.

    >>> # Basic setup
    >>> stc.basic.DEBUG = True # Turn on the debug mode, the default is False
    >>> # When debug mode is on, the HOST link will point to DEBUG HOST.
    >>> stc.basic.DEBUG_HOST = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/' # Default DEBUG HOST is "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

**NOTE**: As the debug mode is off, ``sensor_tracker_api`` is pointed to the CEOTR [Sensor Tracker API server](http://bugs.ocean.dal.ca/sensor_tracker/)


The sensor tracker api requires the use of token or username and password for POST and PUT operations. GET doesn't require authentication.

    >>> stc.authentication.token = "your_token"
    >>> # or
    >>> stc.authentication.username = "your_username"
    >>> stc.authentication.password = "your_password"

To see if your credentials are successful:

    >>> # To verify the username and password
    >>> stc.authentication.username = "your_username"
    >>> stc.authentication.password = "your_password"
    >>> print(stc.authentication.is_username_and_password_valid())
    >>>
    >>> # To verify the token
    >>> stc.authentication.token = "your_token"
    >>> try:
    >>>     print(stc.authentication.token)
    >>> except AuthenticationError:
    >>>     print("token is incorrect")
    
### cache
    
    # sta.cache_on = True

### GET Operations

The usage format of get operation:

    # For full list
    response_data = stc.target_model.get()
    # For filter
    response_data = stc.target_model.get({"filter name":"filter value"})
    # get object by pk
    response_data = stc.target_model.get(pk)

##### Institutions

To fetch full list of institutions

    >>> institution_res = stc.institution.get()

To fetch institutions with name OTN

    >>> institution_res2 = stc.institution.get({"name": "OTN"})
    
To fetch institution obj with primary key 1
    
    >>> institution_res3 = stc.institution.get(1)


##### Response data

All GET operations will return a ``response_data`` object, which contains results and can be converted into
different format such as dictionary
   
    >>> institution_res_dict = institution_res.dict
